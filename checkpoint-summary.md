# Session Checkpoint (09/07/2025)

## Emergency Rollback Summary
- **Task M1 Attempted**: Coordinate alignment between Sensors page overlay and MapView for consistent sensor positioning
- **M1 Changes Made**: Modified coordinate field handling from `location_x/location_y` fallbacks to `x_percent/y_percent` only, changed container aspect ratios
- **Emergency Rollback Executed**: User requested complete revert to 06:00 state, forgetting M1 task entirely
- **System Restored**: Reverted all M1 changes - MapView uses `x_percent ?? location_x` fallbacks, Sensors page uses `aspect-video` container
- **Original Coordinate Inconsistency**: Restored pre-M1 state where sensor positions may differ between pages (this was the intended behavior)
- **Map Interactivity Confirmed**: Sensor dragging functionality verified as working in restored state
- **Backup Created**: M1 state preserved in `backup/post-M1-state-20250907-193905/` for potential future reference

## Current System State
- **MapView.jsx**: Uses `sensor.x_percent ?? sensor.location_x ?? fallback` for positioning, dynamic container (`w-full h-full`)
- **Sensors.jsx**: Uses `aspect-video` container for move sensor dialog, maintains original coordinate handling
- **Coordinate Fields**: Backend provides both `x_percent/y_percent` (database) and `location_x/location_y` (computed) fields
- **Build Status**: All files compile successfully, no syntax errors
- **Functionality**: Sensor dragging works, sensor filtering works, map interactivity confirmed

## Key Files Modified During Session
- `client/src/pages/MapView.jsx` - Reverted coordinate field priorities and container sizing
- `client/src/pages/Sensors.jsx` - Reverted move dialog container to aspect-video
- `backup/post-M1-state-20250907-193905/` - Contains M1 completed state for future reference

## For Future Sessions
- System is fully restored to 06:00 07/09/2025 baseline state
- All M1 coordinate alignment work has been reverted and forgotten as requested
- Map interactivity (sensor dragging) is confirmed working
- If sensor display issues persist, investigate data/filtering rather than code issues
